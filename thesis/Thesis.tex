	Having a notion of peopleâ€™s opinions has always been an essential asset for the decision-making processes in many business models. Therefore, the popularity of sentiment analysis of social media content has being growing rapidly in the last years. However, state-of-the-art sentiment classification approaches lack the capability of performing entity-based classification to identify opinion expressions targeting a specific term, word or entity. In this thesis, this particular problem of entity-based sentiment classification is addressed. 
	
	Combining machine learning and natural language processing methods, the solution proposed in this project uses several sentiment analysis techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), POS tagging, feature vector generation, bag-of-words model and others. These are required to train a Support Vector Machine that classifies tweets (from Twitter) as positive, negative or neutral based on sentiments expressed toward a given target entity (company, person or product). Taking into account real-time sentiment analysis systems, presented solution is developed as a high-performance classifier capable of coping with real-time processing environments. The completeness and effectiveness of this approach is affirmed by quality evaluations and performance tests. 

	
	%Although web resources provide structured data we argue that our integration effort can be beneficial for the end-user.

	It delights me immensely to finally present this thesis to the Department of Computer Science at the University of Bonn, for the partial fulfilment of the Master of Science in Informatik. I would like to thank Professor Dr. S\"oren Auer for his constant support and open arms to accept my thesis proposal. This was a fantastic opportunity and I am fully satisfied with the treatment received by the department and university. I also want to thank Dr. Simon Scerri for supervise this thesis project and always be supportive even in the most difficult circumstances. 
	
	Finally, my sincere gratitude is towards my family and friends who were always there for me. My beloved future wife who did everything she could to keep me on track and focus on our goals. 
	My mother, who I own basically my entire life and achievements. You are the best mother anyone could ever have. Thank you mom! Thank you all!
